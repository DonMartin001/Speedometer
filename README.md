This is code for an in-track Speedometer

SpeedometerLEDLCDClockPhotoGLEDV3 is the code which works for a combined LED & LCD display along with a Green LED indicator light
and it can be used with either Infrared or Photoresistor sensors.

Speedometer2LEDOnly is code which only displays on an LED and uses the last decimal place on the LED in place of the above Green LED
as an indicator light (while waiting for a train to pass).   This also works with either Infrared sensors or Photoresistor sensors.
